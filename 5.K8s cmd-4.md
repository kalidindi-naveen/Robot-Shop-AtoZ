### Pod
```
I want multiple replicas or pods?? to handle traffic
Traffic High?? Increase Pod's
Traffic Low?? Decrease Pod's 

Everytime we need to delete old pod's & re-create new pod's based on Traffic in manual way is not preffered
```
## Solution
### Replication Controller
```
Replication Controller Depricated -- new version -- Replica Set
```
### Replica Set
```
Replica means simillar

Replica set can create multiple pod's
Replica set always gaurante desired number of pods are running.
i want 1 it will create 1 pod.
i want 10 it will create 10 pods.

Replica set will manage pod lifecycle.
Replica Set will watch the pod's 
    if any pod is deleted, it will create Pod immediately to match with desired number of pods
```

### Deployment strategy: Rolling Update
```
A rolling deployment is the default deployment strategy in Kubernetes. 
It replaces the existing version of pods with a new version, updating pods slowly one by one, without cluster downtime.

10 Pod's Running
11 th Pod created with new version if it successfully running
  Delete the 10 th old pod
12 th Pod created with new version if it successfully running
  Delete the 9th old pod
.
.
.
```
