### Internet
```
within network →→ we preffer Private IP only
if we preffer public IP then we need to face 
      more latencies (time to respond is slow)
      less security
      cost: data charges for in/out of AWS network
```
### DNS (Domain Name System)
```
connect to amazon.us →→ get IP address?
    check in browser
    not in browser
    not in our home network
    not in jio network
    exchange point →→ TATA, Airtel, Excel,..
    cables →→ go to US & connect to it

with public IP only we are able to connect to exchange point & cables finally to amazon.us

Buy Domain Name: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
I bought Domain: naveen-kalidindi.com

Hostlinger is responsible for updating the NameServers with naveen-kalidindi.com to TLD

Connect to naveen-kalidindi.com ?? 
→ naveen-kalidindi.com →→ get IP address 
→ check from browser cache
→ check from OS cache
→ check from ISP resolver cache
→ check from root servers in ISP
→ root server will have TLD(Top Level Domain)(.com,.in,..)
→ root server will check TLD for .com in Hostlinger

## we need to transfer nameservers from Hostlinger to AWS
create Hosted Zone in AWS Route53, copy nameservers & give to Hostlinger

→ root server will check TLD for .com in AWS

Create A record in AWS Route53 with WEB Public IP address

naveen-kalidindi.com // will See Robot Shop Home Page.

Flow
----
naveen-kalidindi.com →→ browser cache →→ OS cache →→ ISP resolver cache →→ root server check in TLD for .com →→ NameServers .com →→ A record

Create custom Domain
--------------------
→ .naveen
→ Inform root server that I'm creating a new domain
→ connect with Domain Name provider (Hostlinger,godaddy,..) to sell .naveen domain
```
### Microservices
```
maintainance is easy
language can be anything
individual deployments
server resources can be less
autoscaling is very easy
```

### Communication between server's
```
Create FE-SG: 22 -- MyIP, 80 -- Any Where.
Create EC2 server with name FE & attach FE-SG to it.
IP's
  public IP: 3.89.55.29
  private IP: 172.31.24.189

Create BE-SG: 22 -- MyIP, 80 -- Any Where.
Create EC2 server with name BE & attach BE-SG to it.
IP's
  public IP: 3.91.0.169
  private IP: 172.31.29.189

Install nginx on both

change hostname on both EC2 server's
  vi /etc/hostname

// we can see that FE is connected to BE.
[root@FE ~]# telnet 3.91.0.169 80
Trying 3.91.0.169...
Connected to 3.91.0.169.
Escape character is '^]'.

[root@FE ~]# telnet 172.31.29.189 80
Trying 172.31.29.189...
Connected to 172.31.29.189.
Escape character is '^]'.

Note: Now I want to Allow Only FE connect to BE
Modify BE-SG: 22 -- MyIP, 80 -- FE-SG.

[root@FE ~]# telnet 172.31.29.189 80
Trying 172.31.29.189...
Connected to 172.31.29.189.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
### Robot-Shop
```
1. Web/frontend tier
2. App/Api/Backend tier
3. DB tier

DB apps are called statefull
App/Web apps are called stateless

We can use Nginx as Reverse proxy here.

RHEL = Fedora = CentOs = AWS Linux

Note: 
we can use this AMI: Centos-8-DevOps-Practice.
only avaliable on us-east-1 region.
Not key based 
username: centos
password: DevOps321
```
### yum vs dnf
```
till centos-7 default package is yum
for centos-8/9 default package is dnf
  but still yum is available

yum takes more memory than dnf
we preffer dnf
```

### Proxy
![Forward-Reverse Proxy](Images/forword-reverse.png)
```
Forword Proxy
-------------
VPN →→ virtual private network

Mobile(India) -- VPN -- Hotstar US
Hotstar US doesnt know anything about mobile, it thinks that request is comming from US, it sends data to VPN.

Note: Servers are not aware of clients are behind VPN
      anonymous access →→ hiding our identity
      forward proxies can't understand real clients
      security →→ companies can impose restrictions not to use particular sites, file upload and to monitor use internet behaviour

clients are aware of proxy, servers are not aware

Reverse proxy
-------------
→ clients are not aware of server side
→ apps use reverse proxy to secure their code
Ex: load balancing
```
### HTTP status
```
2** →→ success
3** →→ redirect/temp →→ images, gifs are redirected

failure responses
-----------------
400, 404, 403, 402

4** →→ client side error
5** →→ server side error --> purely project error
```

### Caching
```
Airtel →→ 1000 users

1 user downloaded bahubali movie →→ server from US
cache server →→ will keep bahubali movie

2nd user get from cache server →→ more speed

user was not aware that he was getting data from cache server
```

### Install Application in Linux
```
→→ Install programming language
→→ Create Working directory for application
→→ Create Seperate User for application
→→ Download application code
→→ Install Dependencies
    nodejs →→ npm, java →→ maven, .net →→ Nuget, python →→ pip
→→ Create Service to run application
→→ enable,start Service
```
